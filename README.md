# FizzBuzz
This problem was exposed to us at *Las Palmas DevOps* by Ronny Ancorini.
In this Kata he showed us the way he does TDD and this is the solution in Scala

## Explanation
We should return a sequence from 1 to **n** where **n** is a *natural* number with some conditions:
    - If a number from the sequence is divisible by 2, it should be replaced by **Fizz**
    - If a number from the sequence is divisible by 3, it should be replaced by **Buzz**
    - If a number meets these 2 conditions simultaneously, it should be replaced by **FizzBuzz**
    - If a number does not meet these conditions it should stay as it is
